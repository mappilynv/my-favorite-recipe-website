    <p>Kimchi Stew is a Korean dish that is easy to make and full of nutrition! With flavorful soup and rice, you don't need anything else for your lunch or dinner. Also, do you know that Kimchi is super healthy (and I think it is super food for me)? Kimchi, which is fermented vegetables -- usually cabbage, has many benefits to your digestion as it has abundant probitics. It also has immune-boosting antioxidants. That's why I love Kimchi stew dish :)</p>
